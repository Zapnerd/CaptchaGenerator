# CaptchaGenerator
I'm currently exploring some ideas and am considering using this concept to develop a sophisticated CAPTCHA system. This system would be integrated into a Minecraft plugin, where it displays a CAPTCHA on a map. Players would need to enter the CAPTCHA correctly to verify that they are not using macros.
